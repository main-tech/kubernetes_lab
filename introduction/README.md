# helloworld-deployment.yaml

This YAML file is a Kubernetes deployment configuration used to deploy a simple "Hello, World!" application containerized using Docker. It defines a deployment named `helloworld-deployment` with the following specifications:

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the Kubernetes API version to use (`apps/v1`).
  The apiVersion is used by the Kubernetes API server to determine how to handle and validate the object's specification.
  Different API versions may have different schemas and capabilities for the same resource type.
  It's important to specify the correct apiVersion for the resource you are creating or modifying, as using an outdated
  or unsupported version may cause issues or result in unexpected behavior. The available apiVersion values can be found in the Kubernetes documentation or by using tools like kubectl api-resources
  
- **kind**: Defines the type of Kubernetes resource (`Deployment`).
- **metadata**: Contains metadata about the deployment, including its name.
- **spec**: Specifies the desired state of the deployment.
  - **replicas**: Indicates the desired number of replicas (instances) of the application (1 in this case).
  - **selector**: Defines how Kubernetes selects Pods to manage. Labels are used to match Pods.
    - **matchLabels**: Specifies the labels used to select Pods (`app: hello-world`).
  - **template**: Defines the Pod template used to create new Pods.
    - **metadata**: Contains metadata for the Pod template, including labels.
      - **labels**: Assigns the label `app: hello-world` to the Pods.
    - **spec**: Specifies the container(s) to run in the Pod.
      - **containers**: Contains the container definition(s).
        - **name**: Specifies the name of the container (`hello-world`).
        - **image**: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container (`paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.10.1`).
        - **ports**: Specifies the ports exposed by the container.
          - **containerPort**: Specifies the port on which the container listens (`8080`).

This configuration file defines a deployment for a basic "Hello, World!" application running on port 8080 within a Kubernetes cluster.
